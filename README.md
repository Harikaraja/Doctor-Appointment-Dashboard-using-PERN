To keep patient arrivals at the clinic organized, many doctors use a token system.
When the patient arrives, he/she is given a token - usually a piece of paper with a number on it. The assistant takes note of the patient’s name and the token number. 

When the doctor is ready, the assistant start calling patients, starting with the first token. When that patient is done, the next token becomes active. This keeps happening, and at the same time new patients are also added issued tokens.

We are going to computerize this process using our knowledge of web development. We’ll need to develop a web application that generates tokens, maintains the current token, and announces when tokens change. For the sake of simplicity, we’ll need a web app with two screens.
